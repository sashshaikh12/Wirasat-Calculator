If Hajj was obligatory on the deceased and they could not perform it for any reason, then Hajj-e-Badal should be arranged on their behalf. Remember, acting on this advice is better and virtuous, but not mandatory in Islamic law. However, if the deceased left behind wealth and had made a will regarding these matters, then after covering funeral and burial expenses and settling debts, it is obligatory to fulfill this will using up to one-third (1/3) of the remaining wealth."
